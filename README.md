# Rick and Morty characters

I made an this app using [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) (both versions: 12.1.1) and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) as utility library.

The goal is to display [Rick and Morty](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty) profile characters info taking them from [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/):

- Image
- Character information (name, species, etc).
- Origin and location information (name, dimension, amount of residents, etc).
- Name of the chapters the character is featured on. 

About last point, I choose to display just first episode since the complexity was the same but in this way looks better, just like character's profiles in [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).
